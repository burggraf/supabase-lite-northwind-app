# Northwind Business Application - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The Northwind Business Application is a comprehensive, full-featured business management system built as a React-based single-page application. This application serves as a demonstration of Supabase Lite's capabilities while providing a real-world example of how to build professional business applications using modern web technologies.

The app implements complete CRUD operations across all Northwind database entities, showcasing complex data relationships, authentication flows, and modern UI/UX patterns. It's designed to be deployed as a static web application with no server dependencies, making it perfect for hosting on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or Supabase Lite's built-in app hosting.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Demonstrate Supabase Lite Integration**: Showcase full integration with authentication, database operations, and API endpoints
2. **Professional Business Application**: Create a production-quality app that businesses could actually use
3. **Educational Reference**: Provide developers with a complete example of modern React application architecture
4. **Static Deployment**: Ensure the application can be deployed anywhere without server dependencies

### Success Criteria
- Fully functional CRUD operations across all business entities
- Professional, modern UI that rivals commercial business applications
- Seamless authentication and session management
- Mobile-responsive design
- Sub-second loading times and smooth user interactions
- 95%+ test coverage for critical business logic
- Comprehensive documentation for setup and deployment

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack

#### Frontend Framework
- **React 18+** with TypeScript for type safety and modern development
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **React Router v6** for client-side routing and navigation

#### Styling & UI
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui** component library for professional UI components
- **Lucide React** for consistent iconography
- **Recharts** for data visualization and analytics

#### Data Layer
- **@supabase/supabase-js** for database and authentication
- **React Hook Form** for form management and validation
- **Zod** for runtime type validation and schema validation
- **React Query/TanStack Query** for data fetching, caching, and synchronization

#### Development & Testing
- **TypeScript** for static type checking

### Environment Configuration

The application intelligently detects its runtime environment and configures the Supabase client accordingly:

- **Local Development**: Detects `http://` protocol or `localhost` for development environment
- **Hosted Environment**: Uses `window.location.origin` for HTTPS production deployments

```typescript
const isLocalDevelopment = 
  window.location.protocol === 'http:' || 
  window.location.hostname === 'localhost';

const supabaseUrl = isLocalDevelopment
  ? 'http://localhost:5173'
  : window.location.origin;
```
